## // OFFENSIVE RECONNAISSANCE UTILITY

This Python-based offensive security tool performs comprehensive web enumeration to gather critical intelligence about target domains. Designed for penetration testers, security researchers, and ethical hackers, this utility automates the reconnaissance phase of security assessments by extracting valuable target information.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL DISCLAIMER

**FOR AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**. This tool should be used exclusively on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning may violate computer crime laws. The developers assume no liability for misuse.

## üîç CAPABILITIES

- **Target Identification**: Resolves domain to IP address for target confirmation
- **HTTP Header Analysis**: Extracts server information and security headers
- **WHOIS Intelligence Gathering**: Retrieves domain registration data and ownership intelligence
- **CMS Fingerprinting**: Identifies underlying Content Management Systems
- **Port Reconnaissance**: Scans for open ports and running services
- **Robots.txt Analysis**: Checks for restricted directories and information disclosure
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Discovers potential attack surfaces through subdomain mapping
- **XSS Vulnerability Scanning**: Tests for potential Cross-Site Scripting weaknesses

## üõ†Ô∏è INSTALLATION

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Administrative/root privileges (for certain scanning features)

### Deployment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/who0xac/WebInfoGather.git

## üîí SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

- Use a VPN or proxy to anonymize your scanning activities
- Implement rate limiting to avoid triggering IDS/IPS systems
- Consider legal implications before scanning any target
- Review and understand all data before including in reports

## üíª COMPATIBILITY

- Kali Linux (Primary Support)
- Ubuntu/Debian
- Arch Linux
- macOS
- Windows (via WSL)
